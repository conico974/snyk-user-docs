# GitHub - prerequisites and steps to install and configure Broker

Before installing, review the general instructions for the installation method you plan to use, [Helm](../install-and-configure-broker-using-helm.md) or [Docker](../install-and-configure-broker-using-docker.md).

Before installing the Snyk GitHub Broker, you must configure a GitHub service account token with the [required permissions](../../../../../../developer-tools/scm-integrations/user-permissions-and-access-scopes.md#github-and-github-enterprise-permissions-requirements). All the operations, both those that are triggered through the Snyk Web UI and the automatic operations, are performed for a GitHub service account that has its token configured with the Broker.

You must have Docker or a way to run Docker Linux containers. Some Docker deployments for Windows run only Windows containers. Ensure that your deployment is capable of running Linux containers.
